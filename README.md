This repository contains the complete academic and hands-on materials used in the Faculty Development Program (FDP) on:

Generative AI, Large Language Models (LLMs), and Transformers

The FDP was organized as part of an IEEE-supported academic program, with a strong focus on conceptual clarity, intuition, and practical exposure to modern Transformer-based AI systems.
